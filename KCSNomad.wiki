## Overview

While in the past, we have been able to rely on a single provider for a single product, we are entering
a space which will require using multiple clouds. Because of this, we will be converting our application
and infrastructure to run on an orchestrator - probably Nomad.

We already have a system of Infrastructure as Code in place with Terraform and Packer. To reach this
goal we will continue along the path of containerization and orchestration. This will allow our single
code base to run with minimal changes on different clouds. It will, in effect, reduce the cloud specific
changes to terraform and push them to a cloud agnostic tool, such as Nomad.

## Goals

We need to ensure that our system can be used across multiple cloud providers. 

- self healing in some way - probably ASG
- configuration on the fly - something like Consul Template
- secrets storage - something like Vault
- auto scaling to handle traffic bursts
- full IaC in job files
