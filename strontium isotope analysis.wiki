= Strontium Isotope Analysis =

:isotope:diet:

Strontium isotope analysis is a form of isotope analysis used in reconstructing diets or environments in
various ecosystems. In an anthrpological context, for example, we can associate individuals with certain
environments.

== How It Works ==

- Strontium is introduced into the body through, mostly, ingestion
- Strontium is used in the production of bones and teeth 
- A bone is constantly remodelled, the isotope ratios reflect the ratios of the region
- A tooth is not re-modelled and thus reflects the rations during juvenile period

== Applications ==

- archaeologgy: reconstructing ancient diets
- tracing origins of timber or food
- documenting migration of individuals

== Examples ==

By examining the australopithecines in the [[Sterkfontein]] valley, we can see the following:

- Large teeth (presumably male) have the local geological signtature
- Small teeth (presumed female) were born elsewhere, in a potentially different group
- therefore, dispersal patterns are similar to chimpanzees and not gorillas
